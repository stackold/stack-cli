The tool is open-source and currently in beta. You can also use this tool to learn how our API work. The full documentation of our API is located [here](http://stackrecord.com/docs). Stack-CLI is based on our sister-project also made by Stackrecord for offline release note generation [Vicilog](https://github.com/dn5/vicilog).
